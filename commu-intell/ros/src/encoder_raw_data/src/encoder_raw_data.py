#That number should be the 
#rotations per second of the wheel. 
#You don't need the wheel diameter anymore. 
#So you will start of with some raw data, 
#you will then get the interval from that with some 
#processing and use that 
#to calculate rotations per second.
# You will then publish that number.

## Find a way to import some signal from the encoder


## Some how find a way to Calculate rotation per seconds


# Publish that number in float format.
